# hello-world

The world's most complicated hello world application. Written in Deno to make it easier to contribute.

To make things more complicated, refactor the code.

Rules:

- The tests must pass.
- `index.ts`, when run, should output "Hello, world!"
- Don't add dead code.
- Write a justification in your PR for your refactor.
- Test your code.
- Document your code.
