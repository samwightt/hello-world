# hello-world

Welcome to the most intricate "Hello, World!" application ever conceived. This project, crafted with Deno, aims to push the boundaries of what a simple greeting program can be. It's not just about getting the program to say "Hello, World!"â€”it's about doing so in the most complex, yet elegant way possible.

## Project Overview

At its core, this application greets the user with the classic "Hello, World!" message. However, the journey to achieving this simple output is anything but straightforward. We encourage creativity, complexity, and a deep understanding of Deno and TypeScript to contribute to this project.

## Contribution Rules

To maintain the integrity and complexity of this project, we ask all contributors to adhere to the following rules:

- **Test-Driven Development**: All contributions must be accompanied by passing tests. This ensures that the added complexity does not compromise the application's functionality.
- **Expected Output**: When executed, `index.ts` must output the exact phrase "Hello, world!" to the console. This non-negotiable requirement ensures that amidst the complexity, the program's purpose remains clear.
- **No Dead Code**: Every line of code should serve a purpose. Avoid adding code that does not contribute to the application's complexity or functionality.
- **Justification Required**: With each pull request, include a detailed justification for your refactor. This helps maintain the project's vision and ensures that all contributions add value.
- **Thorough Testing**: Beyond passing the existing tests, rigorously test your code to ensure it meets the project's high standards for complexity and functionality.
- **Documentation**: Clearly document your code and the reasoning behind your architectural decisions. This is crucial for maintaining the project's complexity in a way that is accessible to other contributors.

## Why These Rules?

These guidelines are designed to foster a challenging yet rewarding environment for developers. By adhering to these rules, contributors will not only advance the project but also hone their skills in writing complex, efficient, and well-documented code.
